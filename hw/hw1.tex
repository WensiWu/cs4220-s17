\hdr{HW 1}

The first two problems should be plausible given what you know as of
Jan 27.  Ideally, the material presented on Monday, Jan 30 will allow
you to do the other two problems.  Don't be shy about asking for help
in office hours or on Piazza!

You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Placing parens}
Suppose $A, B \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ are square matrices,
$D = \operatorname{diag}(d) \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ is a diagonal matrix,
and $u, v \in \bbR^n$ are vectors.  Write short
fragments of MATLAB or Julia to evaluate them as efficiently
as possible, and give the complexity in terms of $n$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\operatorname{tr}(DAD)$
\item $v^T (I+uu^T) v$
\item $u^T A^2 v$
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{2: Pretty pictures}
Reproduce the matrix-matrix product timing plots from lecture 1 for your
own machine. Note that the \matlab\ code to run these experiments is in
the {\tt lec/code} subdirectory of the course GitHub page, which is
linked from the home page.  If you would like to translate this into
Julia, it should be quite straightforward!

\paragraph*{3: Making matrices}
In terms of the power basis, write matrices corresponding to the
following linear maps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A \in \bbR^{5 \times 4}$ corresponding to multiplication of cubics
by $x$.
\item $B \in \bbR^{5 \times 5}$ corresponding to differentiation of quartics.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{4: Crafty cosines}
Suppose $\|\cdot\|$ is an inner product norm in some space, and you
are given
\[
  a = \|u\|, \quad
  b = \|v\|, \quad
  c = \|u+v\|.
\]
Write a formula in terms of $a, b, c$ for the cosine of the angle
between vectors $u$ and $v$.
