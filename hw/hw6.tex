These equations should be read in concert with the posted review notes
for the course.  We will go through some (or maybe all) of them in
class on May 9 and May 11.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  In control theory, one often wants to plot a {\em transfer function}
  \[
    h(s) = c^T (A-sI)^{-1} b.
  \]
  The transfer function can be computed in $O(n^2)$ time using a
  Hessenberg reduction on $A$.  Write a code to do this (you may take
  advantage of the fact that MATLAB automatically detects and solves
  Hessenberg systems in $O(n^2)$ time).
\item
  If $A$ is strictly {\em column} diagonally dominant, Jacobi
  iteration converges.  Why?
\item
  Consider the fixed point iteration $x_{k+1} = x_{k} + \cos(x_k)$.
  Show that for $x_0$ near enough to $x_* = \pi/2$, the iteration
  converges, and describe the convergence behavior.
\item
  Describe a fast variable projection algorithm to solve
  \[
    Ax = b(x_n)
  \]
  where $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ is a fixed matrix and
  $b : \bbR \rightarrow \bbR^n$ is twice differentiable.

\item
  Write a system of equations to characterize the minimum of
  a linear function $\phi(x) = v^T x$ on the ellipsoid $x^T M x = 1$
  where $M$ is symmetric and positive definite.
\end{enumerate}
